# Description 
An web app where users can track information regarding stock purchases. The app includes info such as:
1. Current profit on positions 
2. Weekly average investment return
3. Average daily profit/loss

The user will have to input information such as what stock they bought, how much they bought of it, and either at which price, or what date, and the application will take care of the rest.
